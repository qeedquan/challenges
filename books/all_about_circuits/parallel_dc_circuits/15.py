"""

Explain, step by step, how to calculate the amount of current (I) that will go through each resistor in this parallel circuit, and also the voltage (V) dropped by each resistor:

"""

R1 = 1e3
R2 = 2.2e3
R3 = 470
Vt = 12
V1 = Vt
V2 = Vt
V3 = Vt
I1 = V1 / R1
I2 = V2 / R2
I3 = V3 / R3
print(I1, V1)
print(I2, V2)
print(I3, V3)
