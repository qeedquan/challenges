Q: Identify which of these circuits is a parallel circuit (there may be more than one shown!):

A: Circuits D and E are parallel circuits.
Circuit B is a series-parallel circuit as it includes resistors in series and in parallel.

Notes:
The purpose of this question is to get students to identify what distinguishing characteristic uniquely identifies a circuit as being “parallel.” Once this has been identified, there are several conclusions which may be deduced (regarding voltage drops, currents, resistances, etc.).

Some students may have difficulty distinguishing that circuit E is a parallel circuit, but it is!
