Q: Determine the amount of voltage impressed across each resistor in this circuit:

Hint: locate all the points in this circuit that are electrically common to one another!

A:
Each resistor has 15 volts across it in this circuit.

Notes:
The hint suggesting identification of electrically common points is critical to studentsâ€™ understanding of parallel circuits.
Once they see that there is no difference (as far as voltage is concerned) between the top of one resistor,
the top of the other, or the top of the battery (and likewise for all the bottom connections),
it should become clearly evident why voltage must be equal across these three components.
