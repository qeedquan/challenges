*** Capacitor

Power supply filter
AC -> Rectifier -> Place a capacitor in parallel at the rectifier output. This filters (smooth) the output

Voltage spike removal
A digital logic circuits can cause voltage spikes because of switching between high/low logic.
A capacitor placed in parallel with the connection can remove spikes.

AC-DC selective filter
Often an electrical signal has a DC offset. An example is a lightwave communication system.
When dark it has one offset, and during light it has another offset.
A capacitor coupled with some circuit elements can remove the DC offset.

*** RC circuit

Integrator
AC Signal/Square wave -> resistor in series -> output
                                 |
			            capacitor in parallel

This outputs a sawtooth for a square wave.
In general, the higher frequency of the input, the lower amplitude output it gets through the RC circuit.
It is easy to make an amplifier that ignores waves less than a desired amplitude so the integrator can function as a low pass filter that passes signal below a certain frequency.

Differentiator

AC Signal/Square wave -> capacitor in series -> output
                                 |
                           resistor in parallel


Given an AC signal, it outputs a symmetrical exponential increase/decays that has sharp positive and negative peaks.
This acts like a high pass filter.
Used to make narrow pulse generators for television receivers and trigger digital logic circuits.

*** Coils
Used to make inductors

Resist rapid changes in current flow so:

Slow sine wave -> pass through mostly unchanged
Fast sine wave -> attenuates
Slow square wave -> attenuates higher harmonics
Fast square wave -> attenuates higher harmonics and make amplitude smaller
Can be used as a bandpass filter in general

Can add ringing to a square wave passing through it, happens when resistance of external current path connected to the ends of the coil is high.

Transformers
Some of the energy in the field around a coil can be induced (transferred) into a second, nearby coil.
Input side of a transformer is called primary, output is called secondary.

*** Types of coil

Tuning - Tuning coils have a movable core or taps so their inductance (and therefore resonance frequency). Antennas uses these to pick up signals.

Choke - Used in many circuits to limit fluctuating signals while passing steady current. High voltage pulse can be produced in a choke when current flow is interrupted, so beware.

Transformers - Transform voltage/current to higher or lower levels. It is not free though, if they boost the voltage, the reduces the current, and vice versa. Power outgoing cannot exceed incoming power.

*** Transformers

Depending on the turn ratios of the of the primary to the secondary it can determine the voltage ratio:

1:1 Isolation transformer
Voltage/current are unaltered, just pass through. Isolate different parts of circuit and provide protection from electrical shock.

Step-up transformer
Voltage is increased by the turn ratio, so 1:5 turn ratio means output will be 5 times more than input. (Current decreases)

Step-down transformer
Voltage is decreased by the turn ratio, so 5:1 turn ratio means output will be 5 times less than input. (Current increases)

Step-up/down is used in:
Power conversion - Voltage delivered by power lines need to be lowered to be used in household circuits.
Automotive ignition coil - Produce ignition sparks in gas engines.
Tesla coil - Power for TV picture tubes, some lasers, neon lights etc.
Impedance matching - Match impedance of amplifier to that of microphone, speaker or other device.

*** Diodes
Half-wave rectifier
AC -> Diode -> Half wave AC output, the lower side is converted to DC

Full wave/bridge rectifier (Four diodes in series)
AC -> Full wave rectifier -> Absolute value of the AC signal out, so negative values becomes positive

*** Types of Diodes
Small signal - Tranform low current AC to DC, detect (demodulate) radio signals, multiply voltage, perform logic, absorb voltage spikes, etc

Power Rectifier - Functionally same as small signal, but can handle much more current. Mainly in power supplies. Soak up excess heat and transfer it to a metal heat sink.

Zener - A diode that has a specific reverse breakdown (conduction) voltage. Can be used as a voltage sensitive switch. Have breakdown voltages of 2-200 V so wide range.

Light-Emitting - All diodes emit electromagnetic radiation when forward biased. Certain semiconductors like Gallium Phosphide emit alot more radition than silicon diodes. These are called LEDs. The radiation is light.

Photodiode - All diodes responds to some degree when illuminated by light. Diodes specifically designed for this purpose of light detection are photodiodes. Silicon makes good photodiodes.

*** Transistors
Two main types: Bipolar and Field-Effect

*** Bridge circuits
Bridge circuits are mainly used to measure unknown values of resistance, capacitance, or inductance.

Common bridge circuits for measuring different values:

Resistor - Wheatstone, Kelvin
Resistance-Capacitance - Schering, Wien
Inductance - Maxwell, Anderson, Hay

*** Decade box
A decade box is a box that internally has a bunch of resistors, capacitors, or inductors connected in series and parallel with a control knob that can change it with an output port.
So it's like variable resistor, capacitor, or inductor but it is made out of a network of fixed circuit elements.
