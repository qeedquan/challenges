*** Phase

The term phase refers to the difference in time-delay of two sine waves. For example, if you draw sine and cosine on the same plot, they don’t overlap—they are out of phase by 90 degrees.
For linear components (R, L, C), if you apply a sine wave voltage, the current is also a sine wave. If you apply a sine wave current, the voltage is a sine wave.
For resistors the voltage and current always overlap perfectly-they are in phase, the phase angle between v and i is 0 circ.
For inductors and capacitors the voltage and current do not overlap—they are out of phase by 90 degrees, just like sine and cosine are out of phase.
The lead or lag in phase is different for L and C. More details here: Eli the Ice Man.

*** Frequency dependent behavior
Impedance is the general notion of the ratio of voltage to current. Resistance is the impedance of a resistor.

v/i = Z where Z can be the impedance of a resistor, capacitor, or inductor (Zr, Zc, Zi)

In an AC circuit, impedance is frequency dependent for a capacitor and inductor, but not resistor due to the following formula:

Take the magnitude of the impedance to get the total strength:

|Zr| = R
|Zl| = 2*pi*f*L
|Zc| = 1/(2*pi*f*C)

This corresponds to the following behavior in different frequency regimes:

      0   | low  | high | inf
|Zr|  R   |  R   |  R   |  R
|Zl|  0   | low  | high | inf
|Zc| inf  | high | low  |  0

Resistors act the same in all frequencies.
Inductors act like short circuit at low frequency, and open circuit at high.
Capacators act like open circuit in low frequency, and short circuit at high.
