Solving a circuit means you setup a system of simultaneous equations and solve it for current/voltage.

Since every circuit element has a voltage/current, this means that for E elements, there will be 2E independent equations.
Generate equations using:

1. E equations from i-v laws for each circuit element (ohms law/etc)
2. E equations from KCL (N - 1), where N is the number of nodes
3. E - (N - 1) equations from KVL

E + (N - 1) - (N - 1) + E = 2E

This short paper presents an inductive proof showing: For a circuit with b branches and n nodes,
the number of linearly independent KCL node equations is $n - 1$ and the number of independent KVL loop equations of is b - n + 1. (An inductive proof starts super simple and adds complexity.)
