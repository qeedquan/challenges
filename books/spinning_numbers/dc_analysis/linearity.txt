*** Linearity
The 3 elements have the property of linearity so superposition principle holds for these circuits:
Show linearity by using these equations:

Resistors
i = f(v) = 1/R * v

Capacitors
i = f(dv/dt) = C * dv/dt

Inductors
v = f(di/dt) = L * di/dt

The main idea is showing current/voltage varies linearly with it's changing input such that the two following properties hold:
f(ax) = a*f(x)
f(x1 + x2) = f(x1) + f(x2)

A way to see this is to plot the independent variable and the dependent variable and see if we get a line.

Current-Voltage (IV) curves for capacitors and inductors looks nonlinear, but that because the linear relationship between the current and voltage
for those components is with respect to the derivative (dv/dt, di/dt) and not each other.
