*** Passive Circuits
The 3 fundamental passive elements is a resistor, capacitor, and inductor.
Passive circuits have the property such that they do not generate power, but dissapates, stores, or releases it.

In terms of IV curves, passive components lies inside the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the IV plane, since they always consume power but never generate it.

The quadrants as labeled as follows:

The X axis is voltage, the Y axis is current.

2 | 1
-----
3 | 4


The convention is that positive power means that the device consumes that amount of power and negative power means that the device is able to generate that amount of power.
This is why passive components are inside the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the IV plane because of the equation:

(I*V = P) => (positive*positive = positive) (negative*negative = positive)
