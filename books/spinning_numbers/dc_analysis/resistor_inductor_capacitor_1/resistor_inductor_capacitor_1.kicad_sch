  (text "RLC circuits have the behavior of an LC circuit, which generates a sinusoidal wave, but the resistor causes the wave to decay.\nThe waveform is a expoentially decaying sinusoid.\n\nThe mechanical analog of this circuit is a pendulum with friction.\nFriction causes the pendulum to dissipate energy and slowly come to a halt.\nAs a pendulum swings back and forth, friction from both air resistance and the pivot point dissipates energy.\nEach swing gets shorter and shorter until the pendulum finally stops moving.\nIf friction is low, the pendulum swings for a long time before it stops (under damped).\nIf friction is very high, the pendulum makes just one slow drop to the bottom center and stops (over damped).\nAt one precise value, the pendulum will fall to the bottom center as fast as possible, without overshooting and coming back (critically damped).\nOur RLC circuit will display the same kinds of behavior as its current and voltage swing back and forth.\n(Another good mechanical analog is a weight hanging from a spring. If you pull the weight down and let it go, its up-and-down motion is similar to the pendulum's back-and-forth.)\n\nThe capacitor is the one that is initially charged in this case, releasing the voltage when the circuit is closed.\nV0 = q/C\n\nThe equation in for a RLC in circuit is then:\nL*i''(t) + R*i'(t) + 1/C*i(t) = 0\n\nThe resulting characteristic equation is:\ns^2 + R/L*s + 1/LC = 0 (Divide by L to normalize and let s be the derivative operator)\n\nThe quadratic formula applied is then:\ns = (-R +- sqrt(R^2 - 4*L/C)] / (2*L)\n\nIntroduce auxillary variables to simplify things:\na = R/(2*L)\nw0 = 1/sqrt(L*C)\nwd = sqrt(w0^2 - a^2)\nThen s becomes:\ns^2 + 2*a*s + w0^2 = 0\ns = -a +- sqrt(a^2 - w0^2)\n\nWhere a is called the damping factor, and w0 is called the resonant frequency.\nThe relation between a and w0 determines the solution of the differential equation, whether its underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped.\n\na > w0 Overdamped (The solution is the sum of two decaying exponentials)\nV0/(s1 - s2)*L * (e^(s1*t) - e^(s2*t))\n\na = w0 Critically Damped (The solution is the product of t times a decaying exponential)\nV0/L * t * e^(-a*t)\n\na < w0 Underdamped\nThe solution is the product of a sine times a decaying exponential\ni(t) = V0/(wd*L) * e^(-a*t) * sin(wd*t)\n\n\nWe can see this as the solution is of the form\n\nK1*e^(s1*t) + K2*e^(s2*t) (In the case of underdamped, the solution involves e^i, which is a sinusoidal wave)\n\n"
