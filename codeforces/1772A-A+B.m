%{

You are given an expression of the form a+b, where a and b are integers from 0 to 9. You have to evaluate it and print the result.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form a+b (0≤a,b≤9, both a and b are integers). The integers are not separated from the + sign.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.

Example

input
4
4+2
0+0
3+7
8+9
