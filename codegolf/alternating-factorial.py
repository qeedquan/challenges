The alternating factorial is defined as

af(n) = Sum[i=1, n] (-1)^(n-i) * i!

where i! is the regular factorial of i:

For example,
af(4) = (-1)^3*1! + (-1)^2*2! + (-1)^1*3! + (-1)^0*4! = 19

The alternating factorial can also be calculated by the recurrence relation
af(n) = {0,            if n=0
         n! - af(nâˆ’1), otherwise
The sequence of alternating factorials is OEIS A005165.

Task
Given a non-negative integer as input, output its alternating factorial. You don't need to worry about values exceeding your language's integer limit. This is code-golf, so the code with the fewest bytes (in each language) wins.

Test cases
n   af(n)
0   0
1   1
2   1
3   5
4   19
5   101
6   619
7   4421
8   35899
9   326981
