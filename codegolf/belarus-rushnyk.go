We've got quite a few national flag challenges already: AU CH FI FR GB GB IS KR NP US... Here's another, somewhat more advanced one:

Return or print the decorative pattern from Belarus's national flag as a matrix of two distinct values for red and white.

If your language doesn't support matrices, use a list of lists or the closest equivalent. Extra whitespace is allowed on all sides. The matrix can be transposed. The elements can have a consistent separator, and so can the rows, e.g. output can be JSON. You must use the 2012 version of the ornament pattern, not the 1951 or 1995 versions. This is code-golf, so the shortest answer per language wins.

Sample output:
