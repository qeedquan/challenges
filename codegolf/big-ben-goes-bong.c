/*

Your task is to create a program that is to mimic Big Ben (Twitter).
https://twitter.com/big_ben_clock

Task
Whenever a new hour has begun (according to your computer's local time or UTC), you have to output BONG repeated hour times (with a space between the words). For example, when it's 3 o' clock, you have to output BONG BONG BONG. The time format follows the 12-hour time format, ie after 12 o' clock, we have 1 and not 13. The program/function must run forever.

Example:

don't output stuff inside the brackets

(start: 00:34 for example)
BONG               (01:00)
BONG BONG          (02:00)
(...)
BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG (12:00)
BONG               (01:00 again)
(...)
(it continues forever)

Rules
Each series of BONGs must be separated by a newline
Leading/trailing newlines are allowed
However leading/trailing spaces are not allowed
The submission must run forever
Your output may be printed Â±3 seconds from the beginning of the hour
You may not assume the program to be run at any specific hour

This is code-golf, so the program with the shortest bytecount wins!
