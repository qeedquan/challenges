The graph of the modulo operation (y = x mod k) looks like this:

This is a very useful function, as it allows us to create "wrapping" behavior.
However, it is very cumbersome when I want to use it to create an appearance of "bouncing" between two walls.
The graph of the "bounce" function (y=bounce(x,k)) looks like this:

The period of the graph of y = x mod k is k.
The period of the graph of y = bounce(x, k) is 2k, because it moves upwards for k units, and then moves downwards for another k units, before returning to where it started.
For both functions, the minimum value for y is 0, and the maximum is k (Actually, for the modulus function with integral inputs, it's kâˆ’1).
In addition, for both functions, the value where x=0 is 0.

The challenge
Given an integer x and a positive integer k, return an integer or floating-point approximation of y = bounce(x, k).

This is code-golf, so the shortest valid submission (counted in bytes) wins.

Test Cases
  x,  k -> bounce(x, k)
  0, 14 ->            0
  3,  7 ->            3
 14, 14 ->           14
 15, 14 ->           13
-13, 14 ->           13 (12.999997 etc would be an acceptable answer)
-14, 14 ->           14
191,  8 ->            1
192,  8 ->            0
Bonus points for a Fourier-based approach in Fourier.
