Challenge
I need help building a brick wall! Throw together some code for me using no input and produce the following output wall shown below:

_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|
___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__
_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|
___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__
_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|
___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__
_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|
___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__
_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|
___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|__
Now, this wall is exactly 10 characters high and 70 characters wide.

As stated above, no inputs, only code. Least amount of bytes, we have to efficiently build this brick wall. Obviously, this program has to function to get the wall built..? or it obviously won't build itself! Good luck!

Winner
The winner goes to Marinus using the APL language, requiring a whole 12 bytes! https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/99028/61857

Thank you everyone for participating!
