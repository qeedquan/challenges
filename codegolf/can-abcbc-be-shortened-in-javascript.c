/*

So I have the situation where I have one boolean value a and, if that one is true and b<c I want it to end up as true, if a is false and b>c I want it to resolve as true as well. If b=c I want it to be always false, no matter the value b and c are both numbers. My best approach so far is a?b<c:b>c or maybe b^c^a^b<c. Is there any shorter approach? I canâ€™t stop thinking about it, and want confirmation this is the shortest possible way or find the solution...
