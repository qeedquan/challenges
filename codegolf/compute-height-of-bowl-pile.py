Bowl Pile Height
The goal of this puzzle is to compute the height of a stack of bowls.

A stack of bowls

A bowl is defined to be a radially symmetric device without thickness. Its silhouette shape is an even polynomial
The stack is described by a list of radii, each associated with an even polynomial, given as input as a list of coefficients (e.g. the list 3.1 4.2 represents the polynomial 3.1x^2 + 4.2x^4).

The polynomial may have arbitrary degree. For simplicity, the height of the pile is defined as the altitude of the center of the top-most bowl (see plot of Example 3 for an illustration).

Test cases are in the format radius:coeff1 coeff2 ...: each line starts with a float number representing the radius of the bowl,
followed by a colon and a space-separated list containing the coefficients for the even powers, starting with power 2 (zero constant part is implied).
For example, the line 2.3:3.1 4.2 describes a bowl of radius 2.3 and the shape-polynomial 3.1 * x^2 + 4.2 * x^4.

Example 1
42:3.141
describes a pile of zero height since a single bowl has no height.

Example 2
1:1 2
1.2:5
1:3
describes a pile of height 2.0 (see plot).

Example 3
1:1.0
0.6:0.2
0.6:0.4
1.4:0.2
0.4:0 10
describes a pile of height 0.8 (see green arrow in the plot).

This is code golf, so the shortest code wins.

I have reference code.
https://gist.github.com/pasbi/89f86df9fb1049bd3dfb6cffeac093b2

Edit:
The reference implementation relies on a library to compute the roots of polynomials. You may do that as well but you don't need to. Since the reference implementation is only a (quite good) numerical approximation, I will accept any code which produces correct results within common floating-point tolerances.

The idea counts. I don't care if there are small erros <Îµ
.

Another variant of this puzzle is to minimize the height by reordering the bowls. I'm not sure if there's a fast solution (I guess it's NP-hard). If anyone has a better idea (or can prove NP-completeness), please tell me!
