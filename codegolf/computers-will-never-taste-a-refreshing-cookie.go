Inspired by github.com/JackToaster/Reassuring-Parable-Generator, in turn inspired by xkcd.com/1263. The possible words are derived from the reassuring.cfg of that repository.

Having a look at the reassuring.cfg (use the 12th commit) is suggested to see the grammar the output matches (The output is a list of all strings matching the grammar).

Task: Your program must output all 7968 case-sensitive lines of the exact text contained in the pastebin pastebin.com/2SNAJ1VH. A copy of the pastebin is saved in the Wayback Machine

Here is a sample of 33 motivating lines from the pastebin:

Challenge rules:
The lines output may be ordered in any way you want, but all 7968 of them must be included.
The output should be as a single flat string, not as a list of strings.
Your program should accept no input or an empty unused input.
Your program may not fetch data from any online source.
A single trailing newline is optional.
This is code-golf, so shortest code wins.
