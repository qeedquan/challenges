"""

Given a non-negative number n, output the number of ways to express n as the sum of two squares of integers n == a^2 + b^2 (OEIS A004018). Note that a and b can be positive, negative, or zero, and their order matters. Fewest bytes wins.

For example, n=25 gives 12 because 25 can be expressed as

(5)^2  + (0)^2
(4)^2  + (3)^2
(3)^2  + (4)^2
(0)^2  + (5)^2
(-3)^2 + (4)^2
(-4)^2 + (3)^2
(-5)^2 + (0)^2
(-4)^2 + (-3)^2
(-3)^2 + (-4)^2
(0)^2  + (-5)^2
(3)^2  + (-4)^2
(4)^2  + (-3)^2

Here are the values up to n=25. Be careful that your code works for n=0.

Fun facts: The sequence contains terms that are arbitrarily high, and the limit of its running average is Ï€.
