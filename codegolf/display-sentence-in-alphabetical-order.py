"""

Write a program that takes a string and outputs all the characters in alphabetical order. Spaces and symbols can be ignored or deleted, but the upperâ€‘ and lowercase letters must remain the same case.

Sample input:

Johnny walked the dog to the park.
Sample output:

aaddeeeghhhJkklnnoooprtttwy

Rules:

Any language.
Shortest code wins.
