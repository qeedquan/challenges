# Write a program that has at least one byte that, when run, does absolutely nothing. I thought this would be done by now, but I can't find any other challenges like this.
#
# How to tell if it does nothing:
#
# No variables are declared
# Nothing is returned
# Input does nothing
# You could run a program after it and it would run normally
# It's like you never ran it in the first place
# That's it.
