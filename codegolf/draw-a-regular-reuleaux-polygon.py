Related: Draw A Reuleaux Triangle!, Draw a regular polygon

A Reuleaux polygon is a curve of constant width made up of circular arcs of constant radius. The most well-known Reuleaux polygon is the Reuleaux triangle, which has three sides1. In this challenge, you will be tasked to draw a regular Reuleaux polygon of a given number of sides.

A Reuleaux polygon is constructed by taking a polygon and replacing each of its sides with an arc centered at the opposite vertex.

This sort of shape can only be constructed from a polygon with an odd number of sides, so your input will be an odd number greater than or equal to three.

The circles in the first row are shown to demonstrate the construction; Your program's output should be closer to that of the second row (though the center mark is optional.)

Given an odd number â‰¥ 3 and, optionally, an arc radius, draw a regular Reuleaux polygon with that many sides. If you do not take an arc radius as input, ensure that the image is at a high enough resolution that the curves can be deciphered.

This is code-golf; the shortest solution in each language wins.

1 A curve can't have "sides" by the standard definition where each side is a line, but for the purposes of this task I am using the term "side" everywhere for simplicity.

How?
Observing that the arc lengths always sum to half a full circle we let the turtle draw a circle omitting every other of a total of 2n equal length arcs
