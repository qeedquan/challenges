% Ported from @luser droog solution
% Renders each character normally, to get the correct spacing to advance, then takes all the curves which describe the glyph and fills each one.
% Normally the interior and exterior curves are described with different orientations,
% so a fill will leave the interior empty, regardless of whether it's using the non-zero winding rule or even-odd rule.
% Filling separately, it all gets filled.
%
% Usage. String object is expected to be on the stack when the program starts. Extra scaling just to make it visible.
