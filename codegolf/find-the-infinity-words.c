(Note: This is a spin-off of my previous challenge Find the Swirling Words!)

Definition of Infinity Word:
If you connect with curves all the characters of an Infinity Word on the alphabet (A-Z) you obtain the infinity symbol âˆž like in the diagrams below.
All the even connection must be down, all the odd connections must be up.
You can ignore upper/lowercase or consider/convert all to upper case or all to lower case.
The input words are only characters in the alphabet range of A-Z, no spaces, no punctuation, or symbols.
Each word must be exactly 5 characters. Words > 5 or < 5 are not valid.
If a word has double consecutive characters, the word is not valid, like "FLOOD" or "QUEEN".
All the Infinity Words start and end with the same character.

Here there are some examples:

Task:
Write a full program or function that will take a word from standard input and will output if is an Infinity Word or not. The output can be true/false, 1/0, 1/Null, etc.

Test cases:

Infinity Words:
ALPHA, EAGLE, HARSH, NINON, PINUP, RULER, THEFT, WIDOW

NOT Infinity Words:
CUBIC, ERASE, FLUFF, LABEL, MODEM, RADAR, RIVER, SWISS, TRUST,
KNEES, QUEEN, GROOVE, ONLY, CHARACTER, OFF, IT, ORTHO

Rules:
Shortest code wins.
Optional Task:
Find, as a list, as many Infinity Words as you can in an English dictionary. You can take for example as reference the complete list of English words here.

How?
An infinity word has:

the same first and last letter;
length 5;
no equal letters next to each other;
sum of its four alphabet deltas equal to zero;
sum of its four alphabet deltas signs equal to zero;
two positive alphabet deltas or two negative alphabet deltas in a row.
All but (1) and (equivalently) (4) may be boiled down to a condition that the alphabet delta signs are some rotation of [1,1,-1,-1] (where the sign of 0 is 0)

fireflame241 noted that this is then equivalent to the deltas of the deltas of the alphabet delta signs being in [[2,2],[2,-2],[-2,2],[-2,-2]] which may be tested by the absolute values being equal to [2,2]!
