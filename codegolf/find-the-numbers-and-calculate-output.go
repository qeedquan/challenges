/*

Objective
Given an input list of 6 distinct digits, find 3 numbers a, b and c such that a Ã— b = c, with a having 2 digits, b having 1 digit and c having 3 digits. In a more visual way, your program must arrange those 6 digits in the boxes of this image:

If more than one solution exists, you may output any of them.

Input
6 distinct digits. You may take them in any reasonable way for your language.

Output
The 3 numbers a, b and c. The output format is relatively free, as long as the 3 numbers are separated and are always printed in the same order (but not necessarily in the order a, b, c).

Test Cases
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -> 54,3,162
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 -> 57,6,342 or 52,7,364

Scoring
The shortest code in bytes wins.
