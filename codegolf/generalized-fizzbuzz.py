Task
FizzBuzz, but instead of 3 and 5, you'll take the numbers and corresponding strings as input.

You can assume all inputted numbers are coprime (and â‰¥2).
You'll receive one or more numbers, and a string to print with each of them.
The normal FizzBuzz would be something like [[3, "Fizz"], [5, "Buzz"]], but you could also receive something like [[2, "Quux"]] or [[2, "a"], [5, "b"], [7, "c"], [33, "d"], [529, "e"]].

For output, you'll have two options:

Print this modified FizzBuzz infinitely
Take a number as input, and return the first n lines
You must return output with newline separators. An array of lines is not acceptable.

Details
To clarify exactly what this should look like, this is the process to determine what the nth line should look like (first line is always 1):

For each of the inputted numbers n is divisble by, append the corresponding string to the output (for example, 15 would result in "Fizz" + "Buzz" = "FizzBuzz" for normal FizzBuzz)
If n is not divisble by any of the numbers (i.e., the line is still empty), default to n
For example, the first 100 lines of the sample input [[4, "Foo"], [7, "Bar"], [9, "Baz"]] are:

1
2
3
Foo
5
6
Bar
Foo
Baz
10
11
Foo
13

I/O
You can take input in any reasonable format. This includes dicts of numbers and their strings, a single list of pairs (like in the examples), two lists (one with numbers and ones with pairs), or similar.

For instances where there's two strings being appended, such as FooBar in the example above, any order is acceptable (BarFoo is also fine).

Other
This is code-golf, so shortest answer in bytes (per language) wins!
