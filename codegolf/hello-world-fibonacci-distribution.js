/*

Your program should output exactly: Hello world!!! with or without linefeed after.
Your program should take no input.
Sourcecode character distribution must be correct according to:
The number of numeric characters (0-9) must be exactly one fibonacci sequence number.
The number of other non-numeric characters !(0-9) in the sourcecode must be exactly the fibonacci sequence number before the above fibonacci sequence number.
Four examples of valid character distribution in sourcecode:

13 numeric, 8 non-numeric characters.
34 numeric, 21 non-numeric characters.
55 numeric, 34 non-numeric characters.
89 numeric, 55 non-numeric characters.
This is code-golf, shortest code in bytes wins! Good luck!

Edit: As this question has constraints on the sourcecode size in combination with being code-golf the accepted answer (if more than one share the equal winning character length) will be the answer with most votes (and least character-count): 2014-03-01.
