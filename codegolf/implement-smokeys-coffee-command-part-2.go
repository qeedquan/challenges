/*

Like the previous SmokeDetector challenge? This one is for you too ;)
Note: SmokeDetector is a bot that detects spam and offensive posts on the network and posts alerts to chat.

What to implement
Smokey's !!/coffee command uniformly at random picks one of these words (sorts of coffee):

Espresso
Macchiato
Ristretto
Americano
Latte
Cappuccino
Mocha
Affogato
jQuery
adds it to the message: "brews a cup of $COFFEE_SORT for $USERNAME"

Your task is to implement the function that takes a username as any reasonable input format, randomly (uniformly at random) picks $COFFEE_SORT, and prints to the screen:

brews a cup of $COFFEE_SORT for $USERNAME

Rules
Regular code-golf â€” the shortest answer in bytes wins ;)

Good luck!
