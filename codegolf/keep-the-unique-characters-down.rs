/*

It's very simple: Your program or function should generate the following text:

Elizabeth obnoxiously quoted (just too rowdy for my peace): "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG," giving me a look.
Fine print
You may write a program or function, which returns the output as a string or printing it to STDOUT (or closest alternative). You may optionally include a single trailing newline in the output.

Scoring
The number of bytes in your code multiplied by the number of unique bytes in your code

Lowest score wins.

For example, a brainfuck or a whitespace answer would have a huge advantage here, as the multiplier would be very low (8 and 3 respectively). However, generally, writing programs in those languages produces much longer code which may negate that advantage.

Standard loopholes which are no longer funny are banned.
