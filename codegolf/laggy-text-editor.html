Your challenge is to write a program that constantly prompts for input, and when input is given, output that five seconds* later. However, your program must continue prompting for input during that time.

Since this is a bit confusing, here's a demo.

<pre id=x></pre><input id=h onchange='var k=this;(()=>{let a=k.value;setTimeout(_=>document.getElementById("x").innerText+=a+"\n", 5000)})();this.value="";' >

(Try typing multiple things into the box and pressing enter.)

This is code-golf, shortest wins!

*Anywhere between four and six seconds is fine.

Definition of "prompting for input"
I'm not really sure how to define "prompting for input" in a way that works across most languages, so here's a couple of ways you can do this:

Prompt for input in a terminal, recieving it on pressing enter
Open a dialog box that asks for input
Record every keypress and output those delayed - see this fiddle thanks to tsh
If you're not sure, ask. Note that for the first two options, the operation must not block further output.

	<body>
		<script>
			function output(context) {
				let text = context.value;
				setTimeout(_=> document.getElementById("input").innerText += text + "\n", 5000);
				context.value = "";
			}
		</script>
		<pre id=input></pre>
		<input onchange='output(this);' />
