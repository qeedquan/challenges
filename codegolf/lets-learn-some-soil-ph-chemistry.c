Andrew is a chemist, interested in the acidity of solutions and in agriculture. After months of research (Google is not his friend), he came up with the following table* regarding the human-readable level of acidity in terms of the pH (potential of Hydrogen):

         Denomination        |         pH range
                             |
    -------------------------+-----------------------------
    Ultra acidic             |          below 3.5
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Extremely acidic         |    between 3.5 and 4.4
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Very strongly acidic     |    between 4.5 and 5.0
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Strongly acidic          |    between 5.1 and 5.5
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Moderately acidic        |    between 5.6 and 6.0
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Slightly acidic          |    between 6.1 and 6.5
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Neutral                  |    between 6.6 and 7.3
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Slightly alkaline        |    between 7.4 and 7.8
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Moderately alkaline      |    between 7.9 and 8.4
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Strongly alkaline        |    between 8.5 and 9.0
    -------------------------+------------------------------
    Very strongly alkaline   |          over 9.0
Given a non-negative decimal number representing the pH of a substance, output its Denomination. You can take input and provide output by any standard method. The data types you are allowed to take input with are:

Float
Double
Your language's standard decimal number data type
String
And you must output a String representing the denomination. Built-ins related to chemistry are forbidden (Sorry, Mathematica!).

Approximation Rule: If the pH you receive is between an upper bound of a denomination and the lower bound of the next one (e.g. between 7.8 and 7.9), it gets approximated to the closest value between the two: if the pH â‰¥ upperBound of the first + 0.5, then it should receive the second denomination, but if the pH < upperBound of the first + 0.5, then it should receive the first one (e.g 7.85 is approximated to 7.9, but 7.84999 is approximated to 7.8). See the test cases for clarifications.

Test Cases:
Input ->  Output

6.40  ->  Slightly acidic
8.399 ->  Moderately alkaline
3.876 ->  Extremely acidic
10.60 ->  Very strongly alkaline
0.012 ->  Ultra acidic
7.30  ->  Neutral
7.85  ->  Moderately alkaline (the approximation rule is applied)
7.849 ->  Slightly alkaline (the approximation rule is applied)
6.55  ->  Neutral (the approximation rule is applied)
This is code-golf, so the shortest valid submission (in bytes) wins!
