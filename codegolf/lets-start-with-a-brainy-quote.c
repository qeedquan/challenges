/*

The challenge today is to write a program that outputs a known proverb, Where there is a will, there is a way., that means if someone is determined to do something, he will find a way to accomplish it regardless of obstacles.

Output
It has to be exactly the same, including the space bar and punctuation and excluding the newline at the end.

Where there is a will, there is a way.
You may not use Where there is a will or way anywhere in the source.

This is code-golf, shortest answer per language wins.
