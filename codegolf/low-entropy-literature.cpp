This is one of my favourite poems I wanted to share. Especially because it looks good for compressing. Who cares about literature in the 21st century anyway.

sandor weores monkeyland

oh for faroff monkeyland
ripe monkeybread on baobabs
and the wind strums out monkeytunes
from monkeywindow monkeybars
 
monkeyheroes rise and fight
in monkeyfield and monkeysquare
and monkeysanatoriums
have monkeypatients crying there
 
monkeygirl monkeytaught
masters monkeyalphabet
evil monkey pounds his thrawn
feet in monkeyprison yet
 
monkeymill is nearly made
miles of monkeymayonnaise
winningly unwinnable
winning monkeymind wins praise
 
monkeyking on monkeypole
harangues the crowd in monkeytongue
monkeyheaven comes to some
monkeyhell for those undone

macaque gorilla chimpanzee
baboon orangutan each beast
reads his monkeynewssheet at
the end of each twilight repast

with monkeysupper memories
the monkeyouthhouse rumbles hums
monkeyswaddies start to march
right turn left turn shoulder arms

monkeymilitary fright
reflected in each monkeyface
with monkeygun in monkeyfist
the monkeys world the world we face
