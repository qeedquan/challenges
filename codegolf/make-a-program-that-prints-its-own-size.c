/*

Challenge: Create a program that prints out the size of its own source code file.

For example, a 35 bytes size of program must print out 35. Pre-calculation is not valid. What I mean by pre-calculation is:

 // test.js -> its size is 15 byte
 console.log(15)
It must dynamically calculate the size of own source code file. The winner is who prints the minimum number , same as who has the minimum size of code.

#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("489\n");
	return 0;
}
