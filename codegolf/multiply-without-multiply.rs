/*

Write the fastest (best big-O) and smallest multiplication algorithm for positive integers, without using multiplication operators.
You are only allowed addition, subtraction, logical functions (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), bit shift, bit rotate, bit flip/set/clear and bit test.
Your program should be capable of multiplying 16-bit numbers to produce a 32-bit result.
Take input on stdin, separated by commas, spaces or new lines (your choice), but make it clear how to input the data.

Example input/output:

734 929
681886

The algorithm is better known as the Ethiopian Multiplication or the Russian Peasant Multiplication.

Hereâ€™s the algorithm:
Let the two numbers to be multiplied be a and b.
If a is zero then break and print the result.
If a is odd then add b to the result.
Half a, Double b. Goto Step 2.
