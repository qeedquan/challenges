%{

Create a function in your chosen language that prints out the following:

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!
Where cow and moo are strings in the function parameters, and as such, can be changed to pig and oink or sheep and baa, for example.

It should take into account capital letters, hyphens, punctuation, spaces and line breaks.

Aim to type the fewest amount of Unicode characters in your code.
