/*

Interestingly, although there are challenges that work with images, there is no challenge to simply output an image. This is that challenge

Goal: output an image in the shortest possible code.

Output: Any image output is accepted. Files would be preferable, but most any non-character on the screen will function as an image. An example of this is matplotlib output.

This is code-golf; the shortest code that can accomplish the task will win.
