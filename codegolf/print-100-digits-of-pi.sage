"""

Your challenge is to print any 100 consecutive digits of Ï€. You must give the index at which that subsequence appears. The 3 is not included.

For example, you could print any of the following:

1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679 (index 0)

Output may be as a string / digit list / etc.

To ensure answers actually produce known digits of pi, all answers must be verifiable through the Pi API (note: This API counts the 3, your answer should not).

This is code-golf, shortest wins!
