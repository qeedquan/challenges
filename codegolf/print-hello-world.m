Yes, really. Print it with a hardware printer ðŸ–¨ to create a hard copy.

Send the necessary commands/data to your printer such that the following text is printed on a piece of paper:

Hello, World!

You may use any local- or network-connected printer that is available to you.

If your printer allows, you should use 8pt or greater text in black ink on white paper.

The text should appear on its own line. It may be left or right positioned as you wish.

Digital photographic/video/GIF evidence of submissions will be helpful.

If your hardware cannot do paper, but allows other exotic hardcopy production such as 3D printing, CNC machining, or printing at the atomic level, then I will happy to accept such interesting submissions.

To clarify, the question asks "Send the necessary commands/data to your printer". The implication of this is that no further user input should be required. Opening a print dialog is not sufficient. Existing answers that do this as of 10:48am PST 31st Dec 2016 will be grandfathered (but not upvoted by me).
