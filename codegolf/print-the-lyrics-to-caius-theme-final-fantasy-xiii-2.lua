Print or return these lyrics:

Dea Mortis, iuravi
Carissimam servaturum.
Dea Mortis, servabo
Ut tempora recte ducam.

Etsi cor in Chaos,
Aut Fortuna bella ferat,
Occurram et obviam ibo.
The line break must be preserved, and trailing newlines are allowed.

+20% if you omit the end-of-line punctuation, +30% if you omit all punctuation, +20% if you change any capitalization, -40% if you also print the English translation right after the normal lyrics, separated by a blank line:

Goddess of Death, I vowed
That I would protect the most dear one.
Goddess of Death, I will protect her,
As I lead time straight.

Even if there is a heart in Chaos,
Or if Fortune may bring wars,
I will resist and go to fight against it.
If you print just the English version, add +30%.
