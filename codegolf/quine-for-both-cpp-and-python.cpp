You need to write a piece of code that, for the specified language, meets the following requirements:It

must run correctly and output itself when executed under the language's compilation instructions;
It must not contain any keywords of that language in a full-word match context (if you are unsure what a full-word match is, please refer to the Evaluation Details section). Both requirements must be satisfied for both C++ and Python. That is to say, this code must be valid C++ and Python code simultaneously, and meet the above requirements.
Under these circumstances, your code should be as concise as possible.

Line breaks are calculated based on CRLF.
