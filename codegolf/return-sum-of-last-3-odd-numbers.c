Introduction
In my CS4 class I worked with another student to golf this lab as much as possible. I learned a lot about Ruby with it, and I am curious what optimizations could be done. :D

Challenge
The 3rd grade students in Mrs. Johnsonâ€™s class are learning about odd and even numbers. To reinforce the concept, Mrs. Johnson had the students write the odd numbers an odd number of times per line like so:

1
3 5 7
9 11 13 15 17
19 21 23 25 27 29 31
Notice the first line has 1 number, the next line 3, the next 5, and so forth containing all odd numbers in sequential order.

Given the number of odd numbers in a line, you are expected to write a program that will give the sum of the last 3 numbers of that line.

Input
The input is a sequence of lines, each having a single odd number N, where (1 < N < 100). N denotes the number of odd numbers in that particular line.

Output
For each value of N, you will print the sum of the last 3 odd numbers in that line.

Example Input
3
5
7
Example Output
15
45
87
My best attempt is 26 characters, and this took a lot of little optimizations.

I recommend working on this yourself, but here's our solution:

$<.map{p~_1.to_i**2*3/2-9}

*/

#include <assert.h>
#include <math.h>

int
f(int n)
{
	if (n < 1)
		return 0;

	n += 1;
	return floor((n * n * 1.5) - 9);
}

int
main()
{
	assert(f(3) == 15);
	assert(f(5) == 45);
	assert(f(7) == 87);

	return 0;
}
