7 Wonders is a board game where each player can score points by building stages of their Wonder, by war, and by building structures. This challenge focuses on the points scored by building a specific type of structures, the scientific ones.

Each scientific structure, once built, provides the player a symbol, which can be either a gear, a compass, or a tablet1. There are two different ways in which victory points are scored: from sets of identical symbols and from sets of 3 different symbols:

for each of the three existing scientific symbols, the player gains a number of points equal to the number of symbols squared;
for each group of three different symbols, the player scores 7 victory points.
Moreover, there are some special actions that grant the player an additional scientific symbol of their choice.

1: a clay tablet, not a computing device

Challenge
Given the number of scientific symbols of the three kinds and the number of completed special actions, calculate the score.

Formally, given four non-negative integer numbers a,b,c,z, where a,b,c are the number of scientific symbols and z is the number of completed special actions, compute

f(a,b,c,z)=
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 7*min(a,b,c)
max(f(a+1,b,c,z-1), f(a,b+1,c,z-1), f(a,b,c+1,z-1)) if z=0 otherwise

You may assume zâ‰¤2, since a player cannot do more than 2 special actions. You may not assume the three numbers a,b,c are given in any particular order.

Shortest solution wins, I/O format is flexible, standard rules apply.
