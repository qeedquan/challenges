When dealing with long numbers when code golfing, getting the length of your code down can be difficult, so do you have any tips for making a number shorter and easier to manage?

For example, the following Pyth code prints "Hello world", but at 44 bytes, that is unsatisfactory:

Vcjkj85942000775441864767076 2 7=k+kCiN2)k

So how would I shorten the long number, 85942000775441864767076?

=#

println(big(85942000775441864767076))
