Attempt to produce the shortest TeX document that generates the warning

Overfull \hbox (<x>pt too wide) in paragraph at lines <y>--<z>
that signals a line or other horizontal box that is too long in a TeX document.

Any TeX formats for golfing is acceptable.

Rules: Standard loopholes apply, and you may not explicitly print this warning. No more errors or warnings may be produced, and the output can contain anything you want.
