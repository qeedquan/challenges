The Challenge
Implement the Sundaram sieve for finding prime numbers below n. Take an input integer, n, and output the prime numbers below n. You can assume that n will always be less than or equal to one million.

Sieve
Start with a list of the integers from 1 to n.

Remove all numbers that are in the form i + j + 2ij where:

i and j are less than n. j is always greater than or equal to i, which is greater than or equal to 1.
i + j + 2ij is less than or equal to n

Multiply the remaining numbers by 2, and add 1.

This will yield all the prime numbers (except 2, which should be included in your output) less than 2n + 2.

Here is an animation of the sieve being used to find primes below 202.

Output
Your output should be every prime integer â‰¤ n (in ascending order) followed by a newline:

2
3
5
Where n is 5.

Examples
> 10
2
3
5
7

> 30
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
