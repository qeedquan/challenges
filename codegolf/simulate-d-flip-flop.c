Objective
Simulate an edge-triggered D Flip-Flop.

What is D Flip-Flop?
A D flip-flop is an electronic digital device that outputs an inputted data (abbr. D) with synchronization to a clock (abbr. CLK). Usually CLK is a uniform pulse, but in this challenge, CLK may be not uniform.

Input
A bitstring with length n
 will be given as CLK and another bitstring with length nâˆ’1
 will be given as D. A bit represents the state of an input during a unit time (tick). CLK leads D by half a tick.

Output
The output (abbr. Q) is a bitstring with same length and starting timepoint as D. If CLK doesn't start with 01, the starting bit of Q is implementation-defined. Q is updated upon a rising moment of CLK to the bit of D at the time. On the other times, Q retains its state.

Examples
The red line indicates a rising moment of CLK.

Rules
If CLK isn't a tick longer than D, the entire challenge falls into don't care situation.
Though defined as bitstrings, the actual elements of CLK, D, and Q doesn't matter. In this case, if a string is not binary (that is, contains a third character), the entire challenge falls into don't care situation.
