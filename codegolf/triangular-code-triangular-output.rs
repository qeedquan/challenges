/*

For this challenge, submissions should be a program or function shaped like a right triangle, which produces a right triangle of the same size.

What is a right triangle?

For this challenge, a right triangle consists of 1 or more lines, each containing a number of characters (assume all non-newline characters are the same width) equal to that line number:

.
..
...
....
Trailing newlines are allowed.

The challenge:

Your code should form a right triangle, and output a right triangle with the same height made up of any non-newline characters.

As this is code golf, shortest answer in bytes per language wins.
