"""

Given the height, h, and width, w, describing a rectangle of the first hw natural numbers in row-major order produce the numbers in the
order they are encountered by repeatedly removing a strip of the outermost numbers,
each time starting with the top-rightmost and ending with the bottom-leftmost,
but alternating between visiting each of the other two corners.

This is code-golf so try to write a program or function in your language of choice in the fewest possible bytes.

Your natural numbers may start from zero or one.
I will use one here, so 1,2,3,4,â‹¯row-major order is from top-left to bottom-right like English reading order.e.g. for the rectangle with h=2 and w=4:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8

Both h and w will be strictly positive integers.
You may choose whether the corner visited mid-strip on the first removal is:
the top-left corner ("Option 1"); or
the bottom-right corner ("Option 2")
...but this must be a consistent choice - your program or function should always use the same "Option".
You may print the result in any reasonable format or return an array-like construct with the numbers arranged in the desired order.

Example h=5,w=6
Remember, you should use either option 1 or option 2 consistently, regardless of the inputs...

Option 1 - visiting the top-left corner first:
 1  2  3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30  -> Remove: 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 19 25

    8  9 10 11 12
   14 15 16 17 18
   20 21 22 23 24
   26 27 28 29 30  -> Remove: 12 18 24 30 29 28 27 26

   14 15 16 17
   20 21 22 23     -> Remove: 11 10 9 8 14 20

      15 16 17
      21 22 23     -> Remove: 17 23 22 21

      15 16        -> Remove: 16 15
Expected result:

[6,5,4,3,2,1,7,13,19,25,12,18,24,30,29,28,27,26,11,10,9,8,14,20,17,23,22,21,16,15]
