Print or return the following string:

zottffssentettffssenttttttttttttttttttttffffffffffffffffffffsssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnno
This is the first letter of each of the numbers zero, one, two, all the way up to one hundred.

Standard I/O rules apply, but the output must be exactly as shown above, optionally with a single trailing newline. No other variation in output is permitted. This is code golf, shortest code in bytes wins.

Note this has also been cross-posted to Anarchy Golf (by me)
