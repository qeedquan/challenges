Nicky has had Myopia (Nearsightedness) since he was born. Because he always wears glasses, he really hates digits 00 and he loves digits 1 and 2. He calls numbers, that don't contain 00 (two consecutive zeros), the Blind Numbers.
He will give you n, the digit-length of number in 10-adic system, and you need to help him to count how many numbers are there of length n, that only consist of digits 0, 1 and 2 and are not Blind Numbers.

Noteüìù
We include 0 in the begin of number also.

The numbers will be very huge, so return the answer modulo 1000000007

Example
n = 3

The answer is 22. The below list is all 27 possible numbers of length 3, with digits 0-2, and there 5 numbers that contain 00 so we not include those.

[000, 001, 002, 010, 011, 012, 020, 021, 022, 100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 112, 120 121, 122, 200, 201, 202, 210 , 211, 212, 220, 221, 222]
