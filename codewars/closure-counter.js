Closure Counter
Define the function counter that returns a function that returns an increasing value.
The first value should be 1.
You're going to have to use closures.

Example:
const newCounter = counter();
newCounter() // 1
newCounter() // 2

Closure:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
