/*

Task
Write a function which accepts a sequence of unique integers ( 0 <= x < 32 ) as an argument and returns a 32-bit integer such that the integer, in its binary representation, has 1 at only those indices, numbered from right to left, which are in the sequence.

Examples
[0, 1]  ->  3
[1, 2, 0, 4]  ->   23

Because 23 in binary is

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
                                          . . . . . 5 4 3 2 1 0  <-  indices
                                                      ^   ^ ^ ^
                                                      these bits are 1
          due to the corresponding indices being in the given sequence
          
FAQ
The function name contains sort because this simulates radix sort ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort ).

}

assert(sortbybit([0, 1]) == 3);
assert(sortbybit([1, 2, 0, 4]) == 23);
