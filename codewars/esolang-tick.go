/*

Task

Make a custom esolang interpreter for the language Tick. Tick is a descendant of Ticker but also very different data and command-wise.
Syntax/Info

Commands are given in character format. Non-command characters should be ignored. Tick has an potentially infinite memory as opposed to Ticker(which you have a special command to add a new cell) and only has 4 commands(as opposed to 7). Read about this esolang here.
Commands

>: Move data selector right

<: Move data selector left(infinite in both directions)

+: Increment memory cell by 1. 255+1=0

*: Add ascii value of memory cell to the output tape.
Examples
