Task:

Return 'random' Numbers ( 0 <= n < 100 ) with no more than 18 characters.

Math.random is forbidden
Numbers have to be Integers!
The usage of global variables or arrays is not allowed
If the test do not pass within the first time, try to submit again. (at least 50% of the numbers have to be unique) ;-)
