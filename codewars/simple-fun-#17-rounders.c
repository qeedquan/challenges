Task
We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.

Example
For value = 15, the output should be 20

For value = 1234, the output should be 1000.

1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.

For value = 1445, the output should be 2000.

1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000.

Input/Output
[input] integer value

A positive integer.

Constraints: 1 â‰¤ value â‰¤ 10^8

[output] an integer

The rounded number.
