"""

Write a function that accepts an integer n and returns a (3n Ã— 3n ) boolean matrix containing a nth-iteration Sierpinski carpet fractal.

How many 1 bits are there in carpet(7)?

What is the largest value of n for which the matrix returned by carpet(n) fits in a terabyte?

For bonus points, write a general function center_iter(d, n) that generates fractals like the Sierpinski carpet in d dimensions. (center_iter(1, n) is the Cantor set, center_iter(2, n) the Sierpinski carpet, center_iter(3, 1) a 3x3x3 cube with the center piece removed, etc.)
