/*

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

STATION
FIELD   TYPE
ID      NUMBER
CITY    VARCHAR2(21)
STATE   VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N   NUMBER
LONG_W  NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths 3, 3, 4 and 3. The longest name is PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

Create table If Not Exists STATION (id number, city varchar2(21), state varchar2(2), lat_n number, long_w number);
insert into STATION (id, city, state, lat_n, long_w) values (1, 'DEF', 'KABALA', 1, 2);
insert into STATION (id, city, state, lat_n, long_w) values (2, 'ABC', 'XAXO', 5, 3);
insert into STATION (id, city, state, lat_n, long_w) values (3, 'PQRS', 'XAXO', 5, 3);
insert into STATION (id, city, state, lat_n, long_w) values (4, 'WXY', 'XAXO', 5, 3);
select city, length(city) from station order by length(city), city asc limit 1;
