/*

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

COLUMN TYPE
A      INTEGER
B      INTEGER
C      INTEGER

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

A  B  C
20 20 23
20 20 20
20 21 22
13 14 30

Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle

Create table If Not Exists TRIANGLES (A, B, C INTEGER);

insert into TRIANGLES values (20, 21, 22);
insert into TRIANGLES values (13, 14, 30);

             when A=B and B=C                then 'Equilateral'
