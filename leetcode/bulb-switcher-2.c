There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, presses = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off] by pressing button 1
- [on] by pressing button 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, presses = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off] by pressing button 1
- [on, off] by pressing button 2
- [off, on] by pressing button 3
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, presses = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off, off] by pressing button 1
- [off, on, off] by pressing button 2
- [on, off, on] by pressing button 3
- [off, on, on] by pressing button 4

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= presses <= 1000

As before, the first 6 lights uniquely determine the rest of the lights. This is because every operation that modifies the x-th light also modifies the (x+6)-th light, so the x-th light is always equal to the (x+6)-th light.

Actually, the first 3 lights uniquely determine the rest of the sequence, as shown by the table below for performing the operations a, b, c, d:

Light 1 = 1 + a + c + d
Light 2 = 1 + a + b
Light 3 = 1 + a + c
Light 4 = 1 + a + b + d
Light 5 = 1 + a + c
Light 6 = 1 + a + b
So that (modulo 2):

Light 4 = (Light 1) + (Light 2) + (Light 3)
Light 5 = Light 3
Light 6 = Light 2
The above justifies taking n=min(n,3) without loss of generality. The rest is now casework.

Letâ€™s denote the state of lights by the tuple (a,b,c). The transitions are to XOR by (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), or (1, 0, 0).

When m = 0, all the lights are on, and there is only one state (1, 1, 1). The answer in this case is always 1.

When m = 1, we could get states (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0)(, or (0, 1, 1). The answer in this case is either 2, 3, 4 for n = 1, 2, 3 respectively.

When m = 2, we can manually check that we can get 7 states: all of them except for (0, 1, 1). The answer in this case is either 2, 4, 7 for n = 1, 2, 3 respectively.

When m = 3, we can get all 8 states. The answer in this case is either 2, 4, 8 for n = 1, 2, 3 respectively.
