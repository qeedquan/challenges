/*

You are given a 2D integer array called threats where each element represents a security threat with three properties:

ID: A unique identifier for the threat
sev: The severity level of the threat
exp: The exploitability level of the threat
Each threat has a calculated score based on the formula: score = 2 × sev + exp

Your task is to sort and return the threats array based on these rules:

Sort threats in descending order by their score (highest score first)
If two or more threats have the same score, sort them by their ID in ascending order (lowest ID first)
For example, if you have threats with:

Threat A: [ID=5, sev=3, exp=2] → score = 2×3 + 2 = 8
Threat B: [ID=2, sev=2, exp=4] → score = 2×2 + 4 = 8
Threat C: [ID=1, sev=4, exp=1] → score = 2×4 + 1 = 9
The sorted output would be: Threat C first (highest score of 9), then Threat B (ID=2), then Threat A (ID=5) since B and A have the same score but B has a lower ID./*
