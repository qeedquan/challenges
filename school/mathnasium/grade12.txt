*** Precalculus

Counting
243 base 5 = ___ base 10
A: 73

Law of SAMEness
3 + 2*cos^2(x) = 3*sin^2(x)
sin(x) maximum is 1, so the max value of the right hand side is 3
So the only value of intersection it can take is 3, so We need sin(x)=1, cos(x)=0
This happens when x=pi/2, but since these functions are periodic so infinite solutions  
A: has infinite answers

Proportional Thinking
The value a varies jointly with b and the cube root of c. If a = 40 when b = 5 and c = 8, what is the value of a when b = 5 and c = 64?
a=k*b*cbrt(c)
k=4
4*5*cbrt(64) = 4*5*4 = 80
A: 80

Quantity and Denomination
160 degree = ___ rad
160*pi/180
A: 8/9*pi

Wholes and Parts
Find the reference angle to 7pi/4
This angle is in quadrant 4, so we have:
2pi = 8pi/4
8pi/4 - 7pi/4 = pi/4
A: pi/4
