What is the probability of pulling a green marble and rolling a number less than 4?

G = 3
R = 4
3/7

Dice is 1:6 so
3/6

3/7 * 3/6 = 9/42 = 3/14

A: 3/14

Law of SAMEness
Simplify 2x + 5 + 7x
A: 9x + 5

Proportional Thinking
Compare the perimeter and area of A and B.
Perimeter A = 16
Perimeter B = 32
Area A = 15
Area B = 60

A: The perimeter of B is double the perimeter of A. The area of B is quadruple the area of A.

Quantity and Denomination
Write an expression that represents this scenario: Kingsley makes $10.50 an hour working at the local coffee shop. Then, he lets his friend Ausin borrow $5.
A: 10.5h - 5
