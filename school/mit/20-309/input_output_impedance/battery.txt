*** Simple internal resistance model

Batteries used in reality have an internal resistance and it is modeled as a ideal voltage source with a resistor connected in series that causes a voltage drop before the source hits the load.
More accurate models adds an RC circuit connected in parallel with the resistance to model more effects but this simple model is useful enough in common situations.

Usually the internal resistance is specified in the datasheet so we have the resistance to model with.

Modeling it with one load gives the following equations:

RI - internal resistance
RL - load resistance

RI + RL = V
I = V / (RI + RL)

I*RI = VI
I*RL = VL

So going through the load causes a VI drop in voltage.

Solving this for the example problem:

RI = 1.5
RL = 3
V = 9
I = 9 / (1.5 + 3) = 2

VI = I*RI = 3
VL = I*RL = 6

So when the battery is driving the load, it will drop to 6V going through the 3V internal resistance.

--------------

Another way to solve this is using the graphical method; plotting the IV curve of the internal resistance and load resistance and finding the intersection.

The IV curve expresses the relation:
F(V) = I

With a resistance we have:
F(V) = I = V/R

Batteries deliver power and with a simple internal resistance model, R will be negative in this case, so they operate in the 4th quadrant by ohm's law (positive voltage, negative current due to negative resistance).

Since the internal resistance model follow ohm's law, we know the operating regime will be a line in the 4th quadrant.
To find the operating regime boundaries solve for the following:

(0, max current) to (max voltage, 0)

Max voltage is given to us via the battery voltage rating (this is the ideal case where there is no internal resistance).

To find max current, use Ohm's law with where current is maximized. Since current is proportional to voltage using Ohm's law, and we know the max voltage, get the following equation:
Max Current = MaxVoltage / Internal Resistance

This gives us the operating regime as a line equation.

Now we can use that equation with a resistance load IV curve. We need to flip the line from the fourth quadrant to the first quadrant so we can find the intersection.

Solving this for example problem:

RI = 1.5
RL = 3
V = 9

So
MaxVoltage = 9
MaxCurrent = MaxVoltage / 1.5 = 6

Flipping this to 1st quadrant we have the following points: (0, 6) to (9, 0)
This gives the equation:

y = -2/3*x + 6

With the resistance of RL we have:

y = x/3

Finding the intersection gives (6, 2) So the operating voltage will be at 6V with 2A draw which matches the above.
One interesting thing to note is that solving the equation forces the current to be the same (y), and that obeys that resistance in series have the same current.
